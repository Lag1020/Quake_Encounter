Quake Encounters

In this blogpost, I want to talk about one of many of Quake's enemy encounters.

This specific encounter happens on the first level of the second chapter. The level starts you off in an empty hallway. In hardmode, once the player runs into the first open area, they encounter three standard ranged enemies and a wolf. 

After those enemies are delt with, the player has two paths available to them. On the left side/straightforward, the player is able to progress, but on the right path, the player can find optional loot, as well as some enemies. The optional route is the route I am going to be focusing on. 

This path starts off with unreachable enemies, as they shoot from an elevated platforms, and along the path, there is a body of water to the left and right side, containing their own secrets and loot. Following the path however, the player is faced with more enemies and a split path that leads to the same room.

In this room, this is where one of the more enterestig encounters the player will... encounter! On the north side of the room, there sits a suspicious key.

Once the player touches the key, BAM! A surprise awaits them. The player is suddenly being attacked out of nowhere. As the player turns around, they notice where the suspecting bullets are coming from... and it is coming from this guy!

An enemy standing in front of an unreachable hole in the wall! The surprise, the tension! The wall was opened up by the key the player picked up! What's the reward for defeating the enemy? In all honesty, I'm not sure. I haven't been able to reach that area, but personally speaking, this encounter is fun in itself!
